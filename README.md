Description:
  - A simple web application for my logistics and trucking business. It comes with payroll system and semi-auto invoicing.
  
How to use it:
  1. Clone and install the necessary packages from the requirements.txt.
  2. Add a 'config.py' inside instance folder then add your recaptcha_public_key and recaptch_private_key.

Status:
  1. This app needs to be used asap. So the dashboard for the KPI was not included yet as it is not needed for the mean time.
